## Concept Summary
> A looping pendulum is a setup that consists of two loads connected by a light string, which in turn is put over a fixed rod, with the lighter load being held by a person, and the heavier close to the rod. As the lighter load is released the heavier load drops before suddenly stopping due to the tension in the string caused by the lighter load wrapping aruond the rod.

The lighter mass shall be referred to as _m1_
The heavier mass shall be referred to as _m2_

## Investigation
Exploring how the following factors impact the strength of the hold:
 - Number of loops (_n_) _m1_ makes around the rod
    - Angle (_θ_)[°] between the rod and the rope (on the side of _m1_)
    - Length (_l_)[m] of the rope connecting _m1_ and _m2_
    - Weight ratio (_r_)[kg:kg] between _m1_ and _m2_

## Hypotheses
### No. Loops
The greater the numer, _n_, of loops the stronger the tensile force on the rope and ∴ the stronger the hold on _m2_
#### Release Angle
The larger the angle _θ_, the greater the velocity _m1_ gains when dropped due to the increase in vertical height and ∴ the greater the number of loops
#### Rope Length
The greater the length, _l_, of the rope the greater the rate of change of the vertical height of _m1_ with respect to _θ_ and ∴ the greater the number of loops. Additionally, the longer the rope the greater the max number of possible loops for a rod of equal diameter.
#### Weight Ratio
The greater the weight ratio, _r_, between _m1_ and _m2_ the greater the acceleration of _m1_ due to tension of the rope ∴ the greater the number of loops.
